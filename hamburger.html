    <p>This is a tasty burger</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsl ey</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>

        grate.
      </li>

        Step 2:Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley,
        salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls;
        flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto
        each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with
        one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese
        into the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3:Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your
        desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160
        degrees F (70 degrees C).
